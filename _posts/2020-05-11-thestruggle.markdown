Coming from a Biology major to learning software engineering has been a rocky road. Especially when it comes to learngin Procedural Ruby. It was easy learning HTML in Computer Science class but being a newbie to coding in general was a lot to take in. Learning the concepts and new words that were forein to me was a struggle.  Teaching myself through modules instead on learning in class is new-ish to me. Learning the concepts to Ruby takes hours of practicing but nothing is hard just unfamiliar.  One good thing about working with the Ruby community is that it embraces testing and often pairing so that's one way that helps with talking Ruby. When learning Ruby, the hardest part is leanring to do it the "right" way. Starting from scratch in a test driven development makes it a tad bit easier. Before you can reaaly grasp Procedural Ruby, the most important part that I've learned is that you need to know that basics of data structure.
