My second week at flatiron has been somewhat challenging.Learning Procedural Ruby by far, has not been the easiest thing to learn. From learning the different terms such as string, loops and interations, it has been challenging. Having no previous background in coding, working on labs daily keeps it on my mind daily. In order to keep my self motivated I have to remind myself that nothing is hard, just unfamiliar. What I love the most about coding and working on labs is that I can write code my own way and create whatever comes to mind. 

Learning the programming language is not the only battle that I face. The skill of speaking the language and explaining what you have written is also a challenge. I challenge myself during labs to talk out what I am doing and record it in order to hear myself and make sure I understand what I have written. Trying to juggle the struggles of daily life, working and learning to program, I feel that the struggles and the ups and downs are worth the reward. Practicing everyday and asking for help will keep me focused. If you're struggling like me, just know that you're not alone.
