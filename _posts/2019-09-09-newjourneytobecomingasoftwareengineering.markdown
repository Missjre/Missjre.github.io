I've always been interested in how computers work. Technology is constantly evolving everyday. It's a field that I can constantly grow and learn new things each and every day. I love challenges so diving into coding has been something that I've wanted to do. Helping people solving problems has always been a passion for me. If it can't figure out how to solve a problem, I look at it as a challenge to find a solution one way or another. Combing the love of technology and solving problems is one reason that I started this journey. The journey to become a software engineer may not be easy but will be rewarding in the end.
